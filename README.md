This is the README file of my code and data sources of the Top 10 Visualisations Every Data Scientist Should Know repository. This repo was inspired by Towards Data Science's article on the [Top 10 Visualisations Every Data Scientist Should Know](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-viz-every-ds-should-know-4e4118f26fc3). The top 10 visualisations in this project will consist of: histogram, bar/pie charts, scatter/line plots, time-series, relationship maps, heat maps, geo maps, 3-D plots, higher dimension plots and word cloud.
